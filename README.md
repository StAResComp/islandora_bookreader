A Drupal pseudo-module that renders a standalone Islandora bookreader at the path /sites/default/modules/islandora_bookreader/mainpage.php, as was previously provided by [this deprecated module](https://github.com/islandora-deprecated/islandora_bookreader). This is intended to facilitate the migration from Islandora 6.x to Islandora 7.x where there are links (or, more critically iframes) pointing to the standalone bookreader which need to be maintained.
